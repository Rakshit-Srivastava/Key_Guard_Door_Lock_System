# This project brings technology, security, and interactive measures to create a simple way to control access to any building or room. A 4x4 keypad was used to type in passwords for entry. The main part, called Arduino, checks if the password matches the correct one. When it matches, it sends a message to the owner's phone saying "Access Granted". If it doesn't match, the LED lights up, and the buzzer sounds to show "Access Denied" and let others know. All this information goes to the cloud on THINGSPEAK. Using IFTTT facilities, notifications are sent to phones easily. It's a practical way to ensure safety and efficiency.
# To a certain degree, when adapting this project for larger fields, we can consider replacing LED lights with more conventional alarm systems and audible alerts to notify the owner. Furthermore, depending on user permissions, we can explore the potential to extend its capabilities to include tasks like remotely managing lighting and controlling other essential functions within a given space or structure.
